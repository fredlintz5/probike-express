										<li>All items must be prepared and packed by the sender for safe transportation in an express transportation environment with expected ordinary care in handling.

										<li>Pro Bike Express requires that you drop off your bicycle and any other items that we are shipping for you at one of our partner multi-sport shops a minimum of twenty-four (24) hours before the scheduled pickup time. Drop-off deadlines are usually 5:00 pm MST the Sunday prior to the event for which you have scheduled our services. Under special circumstances, other arrangements may be made at the customer’s request; however, please be advised that additional fees may apply. Please contact Pro Bike Express for specifics regarding drop-off times and deadlines.</li>
										<li>Pro Bike Express does NOT provide repeat initial pick-up attempts. If your bicycle or other items that we are shipping for you are not at the prescribed pick-up location (multi-sport shop, or other location) prior to the proper pick-up deadline, your items might not be delivered to your event. Customers who fail to drop off their belongings prior to the deadline are NOT eligible for a refund.</li>
										<li>If we determine that your bicycle, race essentials bag, or wheel bag are not at the pick-up location as indicated on your service request form, we will attempt to call or e-mail you in an effort to determine where these missing items are located. Other arrangements may have to be made to get these missing items to us; i.e., you may then have to deliver to a different drop-off location if time allows.</li>
										<li>If you would like proof of pick-up of your items, you may call Pro Bike Express at 720.878.2088 (mobile), or reservations@probikeexpress.com</li>

												<li>When possible, Pro Bike Express will be positioned at the event near the transition area or race-expo during packet pick-up times if we are partnered with the event director, or another entity. As with all vendors, the event director or other entity will determine if, where, and when we can set up at their event.</li>
												<li>If we are not partnered with the event director, and we are not allowed to set up on the event grounds, then other delivery arrangements will be made and you will be notified. A standard alternative would be for Pro Bike Express to set up at the host hotel, motel, resort, or another location that is convenient and as close as possible to the race venue.</li>
												<li>Another delivery option would be for Pro Bike Express to deliver your bicycle and other items to the hotel, motel, or resort at which you are staying.</li>

												<li>Another drop-off option would be for Pro Bike Express to retrieve your bicycle and other items at the hotel, motel, or resort at which you are staying. If you should have to leave your hotel, condo, or resort early (in order to catch a flight) before hand-delivering your bicycle and other items to Pro Bike Express, make sure you leave instructions with the hotel, condo, resort, or another Pro Bike Express customer that Pro Bike Express is scheduled to pick up your items. Instruct them to store your bicycle and other items in a safe and secure location, which may be different than the initial delivery location. Please inform Pro Bike Express ahead of time that you will be unable to hand-deliver your items to us and what instructions you have left and with whom. Please note that Pro Bike Express will NOT be held liable for loss and/or damage of items left with non-partnered third parties.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li><strong>Undeliverable items:</strong>

												<li>The item may cause damage or delay to other items, property or personnel.</li>
												<li>The item is likely to sustain damage or loss in transit because of improper packaging or otherwise.</li>
												<li>The item contains any prohibited items.</li>
												<li>The account of the person or entity responsible for payment is not in good credit standing.</li>
												<li>When acceptance of the item may jeopardize our ability to provide service to other customers.</li>

In these instances it shall NOT be the responsibility of Pro Bike Express to pay for resulting costs and expenses, including, but not limited to rental equipment, purchase of equipment and personal luggage contents.</li>
										<li>Pro Bike Express will be liable for personal property only for the period during which it is in the possession of Pro Bike Express. Pro Bike Express (or its partners) do not condone or assume liability or responsibility for property left unattended while waiting for pick-up by the carrier. Pro Bike Express is NOT responsible for any equipment or bags after they are delivered to their final destination. Nor is Pro Bike Express negligent for a delay of delivery, if the customer’s identification is not present on or with the items being shipped.</li>
										<li>Pro Bike Express is NOT negligent if items are delayed due to a designated contact person not being available for pick-up or delivery. Pro Bike Express might not attempt to deliver multiple times before sending the item back to the sender, if this would cause delays with other deliveries. Arrangements can be made with Pro Bike Express to reschedule deliveries to the same or different address (additional fees may apply). If no arrangements are made, and the gear is sent back, Pro Bike Express is NOT responsible for rerouting delivery charges.</li>

					        Pro Bike Express will NOT be held liable for regulatory delays caused by Customs or Immigration inspections. Such delays are manifest and beyond the control of Pro Bike Express. To complete international deliveries, Pro Bike Express requires a copy of your passport, round-trip flight itinerary, race registration, and complete packing list of items being sent. Items must be personal effects sent to the foreign country for your personal and temporary use. Packages sent internationally may NOT be locked (this includes TSA locks), as customs may need to perform an inspection. If packages are locked, this could cause delays. Pro Bike Express is NOT responsible for delays or damage to suitcases due to locked packages. Pro Bike Express shall NOT be held liable for duties and surcharges arising from international deliveries; all such fees shall be passed on to the customer. Pro Bike Express will take every step possible to ensure that the proper paperwork is prepared and filed in order to prevent excessive and inappropriate duties and surcharges arising from international deliveries. For one-way transportation of a bag going to Canada, you are subject to payment of duties and taxes unless you can provide proof that the bag exited the country (i.e.: tracking number or airline baggage tag). If this information is not immediately available at the time of duty and tax assessment, you will need to pay the fee and be refunded upon providing proof of re-export. Pro Bike Express may charge duties and taxes (at the time of order booking, or at a later date) for certain countries with a high occurrence of duties and taxes charges.

					        Pro Bike Express has a US $250,000 cargo insurance policy in place. If our cargo is at full capacity (46 bicycles), liability is limited to US $5,435 on average per customer for all items shipped. If our cargo is at half capacity (23 bicycles), liability is limited to US $10,870 on average per customer for all items shipped. If Pro Bike Express is shipping items for you valued beyond this liability limit, you, at your sole discretion may determine whether additional insurance is necessary. Additional insurance may be available through other sources such as your homeowner’s insurance policy or other insurance policy. Please contact your insurance company or insurance agent to determine if your homeowner’s policy provides this type of coverage, or if you should purchase additional insurance. Here are a few guidelines:
									<ul>
										<li>Cargo insurance coverage covers the physical loss or damage of bicycles, race wheels, and race equipment (helmets, wetsuits, bike shoes, etc.).</li>
										<li>Cargo insurance does not cover loss of use or loss of income associated with the physical loss or damage of items.</li>
										<li>Additional insurance coverage is not currently available through or from Pro Bike Express.</li>
										<li>The total valuation of your items may exceed US $5,200, but may not be insured beyond the US $5,200 limit if our cargo is at full capacity (48 bicycles).</li>
										<li>Pro Bike Express will insure provided the items are correctly described, properly packaged, correctly valued, and undamaged prior to shipping. Maximum liability is not automatic and damage or loss value must be proven to the insurance adjuster.</li>
										<li>Excess insurance is not available and may not be purchased for items excluded from our liability, such as jewelry, cash, computers, i-Pods, MP3 players, cameras, etc. Please see the “Fragile Items Liability” list above for details.</li>
